    <h1>Echo Kane</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Recently, I changes my degree from Computer Science (and a 3D animation minor) to Visual Communication Design (with the same minor). I am 21 years old, and for the last few years I have lived and worked in the residence halls at Eastern. I'm the proud owner of two plants and two goldfish, who like to beg me for food while I do homework (the goldfish, not the plants).</p>
    <p>Originally from Pasco, I moved to Cheney when I started school here at Eastern at the age of 19. Before I moved here, I worked for Western Peterbilt, a semi truck company where I delivered semi parts to stores and garages within about a hundred mile radius.</p>
    <p>I have three younger brothers, making me the oldest of four. There is no question that they are my siblings, because we all look like clones of our dad. We're all quite the jokesters, but I have to remember to keep it clean and not mean, because my brothers are 14, 11 and 7, so there is quite the gap between us.</p>
